# blended-template

Blended App template SDK for Solidity and Rust WASM contracts with Javascript ethers.js test scripts.

## Documentation

## Deploy Blended Contracts

### Step 1 - Deploy Rust Contract

Change directory to `rust` contract folder

```shell
cd rust
```

Compile Rust contract for WASM binary 

```shell
gblend build rust -r
```

Deploy Rust contract with WASM binary

```shell
gblend deploy \
--chain-id 20994 \
--rpc https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz/ \
--private-key $devTestnetPrivateKey \
--gas-limit 3000000 \
lib.wasm
```

Copy this deployed Rust contract address, 
since this will be used for the Solidity contract communication.

⚠️ Note: to update Rust crate `fluentbase-sdk` if there are issues: ⚠️

```shell
cargo clean
cargo update -p fluentbase-sdk
```

### Step 2 - Deploy Solidity Contract

Switch back to the root of this repo, then switch to the `solidity` contract folder

```shell
cd ../
cd solidity
```

Deploy the Solidity contract with the Rust contract address 
with the Forge flag which defines path to constructor input text file `--constructor-args-path`

```shell
forge create src/FluentSdkRustTypesTest.sol:FluentSdkRustTypesTest \
--constructor-args-path src/deployConstructor/FluentSdkRustTypesTest.txt \
--private-key $devTestnetPrivateKey \
--rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.fluent.xyz/ \
--broadcast \
--verify \
--verifier blockscout \
--verifier-url https://testnet.fluentscan.xyz/api/
```

Foundry test fork deployed contracts on Fluent testnet 

```shell
forge coverage --fork-url https://rpc.dev.gblend.xyz/
```

### Step 3 - Test Javascript ethers.js Interaction

Switch back to the root of this repo, then switch to the `javascript` folder

```shell
cd ../
cd javascript
```

Install packages such as ethers.js with `package.json` with

```shell
npm i
```

Run the ethers.js test script to have the Solidity contract call the Rust contract

```shell
node solidity.js
```

Run the ethers.js test script to call the Rust contract directly (using Solidity interface ABI)

```shell
node rust.js
```

This ethers.js Javascript example can be 
modified from node.js to a frontend application for users to interact with.
